# 🐧 Nihilist Penguin

**Nothing matters. The penguin runs anyway.**

Nihilist Penguin is a minimalist, atmospheric endless-runner where a lone penguin keeps moving across an unforgiving ice path — not because it leads anywhere, but because stopping doesn’t change anything either.

Jump over obstacles, survive as long as you can, and eventually accept that the mountain does not care. Inspired by Nihilist Penguin meme. Lmao.
